    What does it do?

This input manager is convenient if you want to double or triple click to select xml (or xhtml) tags. Put the mouse cursor on the opening '<' or closing '>' character of a tag and:
 * a double click will select the complete tag
 * a triple click will select the complete open and close tag (or beep at you and select as far as it can get if you have malformed xml).

It will work with any program that is based on the Cocoa frameworks.


    Where do I put it?

You can make it available to yourself by dropping the "XMLTagInputManager" folder in your "~/Library/InputManagers". Or make it available to everybody on your machine in "/Library/InputManagers".
(Create the "InputManagers" folder if it's not already there.)


	Problems?

I haven't found any yet, but you can always contact me if you find a problem (besides a detailed error description, send the file that causes a problem too if that is possible).
Other things you have to be careful of:
 * If you use TextExtras, make sure you don't use '<' and '>' as opening and closing braces for "Select to Matching Brace" or "Show to Matching Brace". Here's what you can do, execute the following in a terminal:
 	defaults write NSGlobalDomain TEOpeningBracesCharacters -string '{[('
	defaults write NSGlobalDomain TEClosingBracesCharacters -string '}])'
 * If you have a construction like:
 	<p><h3>Technical Support:</h3>
   And you click the the closing character of the "<p>" tag, the "<h3>" tag will be selected. This is a decision I had to make because at that point I do not have enough information to determine that you clicked inside the "<p>" tag and I had to choose what to do. I chose the situation that will allow you to select a tag using my code. If you would have double clicked the '<' of the "<p>" tag, it would select that tag.


	Acknowledgements

The idea of this input manager came from a similar bundle that was available for OpenStep but I couldn't find an implementation for Mac OS X. I can't remember who wrote it but I missed it a lot!

I would like to thank Mike Ferris for making the source code available to TextExtras! I learned a lot from his code in order to implement this bundle. Kudos as well to Michael McCracken for his IncrementalSearchInputManager code, I took a good look at that as well. Both bundles I can't live without anymore...
